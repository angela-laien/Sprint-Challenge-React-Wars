1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

    React is an open-source JavaScript library used for building user interfaces for single-page applications. It allows us to create reusable UI components. For Example, one NameCard props can be used in all Star Wars characters.

2. What does it mean to think in react?
    Break the UI into a component hierarchy, implement the app by building a version that takes the data model and renders the UI but has no interactivity, Identify the minimal representation of UI state, and identify where the state should live.


3. Describe state.
    “State” is an object that determines how that component renders & behaves. It allows developer to create components that are dynamic and interactive.

4. Describe props.
    props are variables passed to it by its parent component. The state can be initialized by props.

5. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?
    Side effects affects something outside of the scope of the current function that’s being executed like API requests to backend service. By using this effectHook, developers tell React that the component needs to do something after render. React will remember the function just passed and call it later after performing the DOM updates. In this effect, developers can perform data fetching or call some other imperative API.
